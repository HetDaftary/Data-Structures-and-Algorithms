# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
The code for the most commonly used data structures and algorithms is added here. 
To make the data structures, more reusable, I have a template class in c++ for each data structure and added the code there so you can use them in way you want.

# Strucure: 
The structure is simple. 
One .md file to explain and document the code. 
The includer.hpp file containing the reference to the library to be used. 
The code goes in src folder in .hpp files so we can include and use it. 
The test code go in the tests folder inside the data structure or algorithm. 
So, the over all folder for the a particular code folder have includer.hpp file, src folder, tests folder and an md file for explaination realted to it.
