# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Will cover Data Structures and algorithms related codes written in C++. 
Will be having class of each data structure in .hpp files which can be included when we want to use something. 
There is also a .cpp file which uses this library to test the functionalities. 
The goes has folders src and tests where the src has the library to include and tests folders contains the .cpp files and we include the library there to  test it. 

Data-Structures:
  1. Stack
  2. Queue
  3. Linked-Lists
    3.1. Singly-Linked-Lists
    3.2. Circular-Linked-Lists
    3.3. Doubly-Linked-Lists
