# Functionalities implemented:
* <b>fibonacci: </b> gets nth fibonacci  number..

# Some important points:
* Uses the solution of recurrance relation of Fibonacci, we get the answer in logn time.
* Argument of type is usigned int. 
* Time: O(log(n)).
* Space: O(log(n))
* Example: double ans = fibonnaci(5);
